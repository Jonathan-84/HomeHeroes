 ## Version
 This is project version 2.0. Version 1.0 was a bootcamp group project. During that 2 week project, I successfully built the mySQL backend but my collaborators couldn't successfuly build the front-end. This version 2.0 removes any front-end capability that may have been in place, keeping only thenctional back-end. The Front-end will be built from the ground up.
